# Coding Challenge
## Introduction

Welcome to the movies Coding Challenge.

Please set aside **no more than two weeks** to complete this exercise. Get as far as you can, but youâ€™re not required to complete the task! The purpose of this exercise is to get a feel for your approach to problem solving, code style, and comfort with different aspects of developing for the web.

If you have any questions or get stuck on something (including setup), don't hesitate to send us an email at mail@justo.mx. Good luck!

## Movie Showtimes App

Build an interactive, responsive movie showtimes app as shown in the mock images.

### Instructions

- Use the https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/imdb8 API to fetch movies data, specifically you can use the `GET title/find` endpoint. (You will need to signup to use the API but you can use the basic plan that is free)
- Use any frontend framework/library/build tool you are comfortable with, designing the app for the possibility of expanding features, feel free to customize the UI as you want
- Include your `bower.json`, `gulpfile.js`, `package.json`, etc if/as necessary
- Using the mock images as reference, but you can customize the UI as you want
- Responsive Behavior: Make sure the app gracefully scales down to a mobile view

### Optional/Bonus

If you find yourself with time to spare, feel free to improve functionality as you see fit (by no means required). We've outlined some of our ideas below:

- Sort movies by title
- Sort showtimes by date/time
- CSS "Fade" showtimes that have already passed

## Submit Your App

Zip project directory and send it our way: [mail@justo.mx](mailto:mail@justo.mx)

Assume we will install and run any dependency/build process necessary, so make sure to include relevant files.

### Thanks!

We really appreciate you taking the time for this challenge.
